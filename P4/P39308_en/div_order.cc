// Input: several cases, each with a natural number n between 1 and 109.
// Output:  For every n, the divisors of n in increasing order.
// Hint: Every divisor smaller than the square root of n has a corresponding divisor greater than the
// square root of n. It could be useful to make two loops, one for “small” divisors, and another for “large” divisors.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  while (cin >> n) {
    // loop for small divisors, from 0 to √n
    while ()


    // loop for large divisors, from n to √n
  }
}
