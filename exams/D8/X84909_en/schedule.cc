// Input: an unknown number of listing: subject name day start_time end_time. day is {monday,tuesday,wednesday,thursday,friday} and h1<h2 are {0,...,24}

// Output: two tables as shown in the examples. One listing the number of classes given at each hour of the week. The other showing the number of different
//  teachers giving class at each hour of the week (that is, the number of teachers giving class that hour and day after having removed repetitions).
//  Finally, a natural which is the minimum number of hours of class where we need to replace a current professor with a new one in order to avoid conflicts, 
//  that is, in order to prevent any teacher from being giving two classes simultaneously.
