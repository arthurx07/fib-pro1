// A media library is a program used to organise digital audio on a personal computer. Among many other functions, the user can access the
//  attributes of a song, such as: artist, title, genre and year. You have to make a program supporting queries to the media library.
// In particular, once the data available on the library has been read by your program, a genre (e.g., Rock) can be introduced to retrieve all
//  the songs belonging to this genre, listed by artist, year and title order.
// Input: The input consists of a number n â‰¥ 0 followed by n songs, each of which consists of three strings (artist, title and genre) and
//  an integer (year). This is followed by a sequence of strings (genres).
// Output: For each genre in the input, print all the songs of that genre sorted by artist and, within artist, by year, and then by title.
